## Meeting Log 09-30-18
* Made the GitHub repo for three sections
* Last week we decided our team name and project ideas, now we're starting from the top of the project Milestones
* Took first milestone step by step and delegated work of each section to a group member and edited each One
* Started with a Google Doc and commited everything to the GitHub via markdown. Can create a PDF from this Markdown once the file is complete (see to-do list)
* Started talking about the architecture of the website and discussed how the layers will fit together
